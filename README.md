A Python library for e621's API.

Disclaimer
===========
**This is nowhere near complete and not yet meant for general use** and its current functionality doesn't extend beyond 
fetching posts.

Disclaimer #2
==============
If you use this irresponsibly and abuse e621's (or anyone else's) API, I'm not responsible for any damage you cause. 
Similarly, if by using this, you would be breaking the law, I'm not responsible if you get in trouble. Again, use this 
at your own risk.
